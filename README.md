# Candidata
A web app that displays data from three political data sources:

* Polling data from [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/)
* Recently rated statements from [PolitiFact](https://www.politifact.com/)
* Campaign contributions from [OpenSecrets](http://www.opensecrets.org/)

Allows filtering the data based on which issue you care about most (economy, health care, terrorism, and the environment)
